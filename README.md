# math-bubble-shooter
game for TOP game-jam, theme: edutainment

## About:
I'm making this game for the game jam. It is similar to the times table game I made, but it will be more interactive/playable and there will be other sums/questions, not just multiplication. Eventually, it will be split into age ranges, but I probably won't have time for that initially so I will do it later.

### MVP:
* box that shows question
* bubbles that have various answers in them, one correct
* a timer
* results page
* simple pop effect on clicking bubble
* cool background

### Possible extra features:
* age apropriate questions/ select age
* select difficulty (more/less time)
* fancier popping effects and transitions
* shooting effect
* general animations
* ticking sound on timer/ sound settings
* leaderboard
